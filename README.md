# Csharp_Projects
During high school I learned for the first time what programming was. 
I fell in love when I started doing projects and little games in visual studio 2019 with C#.

Since then I've improved a lot my programming skills. And I am very happy that C# was my very first programming language.

Hope you like my C# games and projects!
